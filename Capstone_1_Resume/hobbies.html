    <h1>These are my hobbies!</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>I'll divide it into two parts:</p>
    <p>The <b>first</b> one are the hobbies that <b>makes me money</b> on the side,</p>
    <p>and the <b>second</b> one are the hobbies <b>that just for fun</b>.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies for Money</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Macro Games</li>
            <ul><i>- I make some macro to those games that have repetitive movements and sell the script or the items to other players.</i></ul><br>
        <li>Cryptocurrency and Forex Trading</li>
            <ul><i>- As the basic concept of basic supply and demand, <b>"You buy low, you sell high"</b> (Trade at your own risk, I am not a financial advisor).</i></ul><br>
        <li>Programming</li>
            <ul><i>- Given that it is my college program, it started literally just a hobby but I enhance my skill more to the point where it actually helps me to land a job.</i></ul>
    </ul>
